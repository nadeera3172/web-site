        <h3> Sea Turtle Farm in Hikkaduwa</h3>

        <p>
        Turtle farm in Hikkaduwa or Sea Turtle Hatchery & Rescue Center is a small and yet a very nice turtle farm and rescue center. Here visitors may see turtle eggs which are safely buried in the sand hatchery. It usually takes two days for eggs to hatch. Turtles are held really gently with great attention to their proper development so that they can later be safely released into the sea where they can live in their natural habitat. This is the reason why here visitors can see  turtles in many different sizes; turtles need to grow in order to be released and continue living on their own.
        Regrettably, visitors will also be able to see turtles with mutilated bodily parts sadly, for instance without forelegs or hind legs . This bodily harm is normally afflicted by boat engines. Once they lose one of their limbs, turtles get off balance and it takes quite some time till they recover in order to have full body command the same as prior to the accident. This is why this farm is also considered to be a unique shelter that helps disabled turtles to find their body balance and sustain their lives.

            Ramparts and bastions embrace the picturesque streets of this sprawling Unesco-listed site, built by the Portuguese in the 16th century and added to over the next 350 years by the British and the Dutch. The layers of history are visible as you amble about these sun-bleached colonial streets, including grand stone mansions, churches, mosques, museums and cafes. Make a stop for a cooling drink at the Amangalla Hotel and head to the lighthouse to survey the drama of the crashing Indian Ocean waves.

            <h3> Settle in for a Madu River Safari</h3>

        <p> 
            Experience paradise as you drift in the shade of the mangroves that line the banks of the Madu Ganga River, stopping by cinnamon plantations and small islands along the way. There are more than 60 outcrops dotting the river, the most unique being Satha Paha Doowa, aka Five Cent Island. It might be the smallest island along Madu Ganga – it can barely support the Budhist temple that rises from its low landmass – but it’s Instagram gold. The waters are home to flickering doctor fish and you may even spot a crocodile or two.
