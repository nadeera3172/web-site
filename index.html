    A laid-back coastal town on the south coast of Sri Lanka, Bentota is the very essence of chilled holiday living. You’ve got friendly fishermen to mingle with, isolated beaches to more or less call your own and a sprinkling of spiritual spots that will show you the meaning of tranquillity. You can also expect first-rate watersports, river adventures, diving among irridescent fish and much, much more besides.It is approximately 65 kilometres south of Colombo and 56 kilometres north of Galle. Bentota is situated on the southern bank of the Bentota River mouth, at an elevation of 3 metres above the sea level. The name of the town is derived from a mythical story which claims a demon named 'Bem' ruled the tota or river bank.

<h3> Sea Turtle Farm in Hikkaduwa</h3>

<img class="biggerimage" src="./Images1/image33.jpg">
<p id="places_p">
Turtle farm in Hikkaduwa or Sea Turtle Hatchery & Rescue Center is a small and yet a very nice turtle farm and rescue center. Here visitors may see turtle eggs which are safely buried in the sand hatchery. It usually takes two days for eggs to hatch. Turtles are held really gently with great attention to their proper development so that they can later be safely released into the sea where they can live in their natural habitat. This is the reason why here visitors can see  turtles in many different sizes; turtles need to grow in order to be released and continue living on their own.

<h3> Explore the Galle Dutch Fort</h3>
<div class="flexcontainer">
<img class="biggerimage" src="./Images1/image21.jpg">

<p id="places_p"> 
    Ramparts and bastions embrace the picturesque streets of this sprawling Unesco-listed site, built by the Portuguese in the 16th century and added to over the next 350 years by the British and the Dutch. The layers of history are visible as you amble about these sun-bleached colonial streets, including grand stone mansions, churches, mosques, museums and cafes. Make a stop for a cooling drink at the Amangalla Hotel and head to the lighthouse to survey the drama of the crashing Indian Ocean waves.

    <h3> Settle in for a Madu River Safari</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer"> 
    <img class="biggerimage" src="./Images1/image22.jpg"/>
<p id="places_p"> 
    Experience paradise as you drift in the shade of the mangroves that line the banks of the Madu Ganga River, stopping by cinnamon plantations and small islands along the way. There are more than 60 outcrops dotting the river, the most unique being Satha Paha Doowa, aka Five Cent Island. It might be the smallest island along Madu Ganga – it can barely support the Budhist temple that rises from its low landmass – but it’s Instagram gold. The waters are home to flickering doctor fish and you may even spot a crocodile or two.

<h3>Get stuck into windsurfing</h3>
<div class="flexcontainer">
<img class="biggerimage"  src="./Images1/image25.jpg"/>
<p id="places_p">
    Skim the waves at speed and feel the spray against your sunkissed skin on the open waters surrounding Bentota, a prize spot for surfing and windsurfing. Fear not if you’re new; the more tranquil waters of the Bentota River make practice a cinch. Try to come between November and April, before the wet season powers in and things become altogether choppier.

   Explore the home of renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, exquisitely designed with an array of rare flora.If you’d like an afternoon letting both your mind and legs wander, you’ll love these pathways decorated with jungle flowers that were once home to Bevis Bawa, brother of Geoffrey, Sri Lanka’s biggest architectural name. Since 1970 they’ve been welcoming visitors – a fantasy landscape of arty creations, statues and head-turning trees (more than 160 species). It’s just 10km (6mi) inland from Bentota for an easy, escapist day out.
